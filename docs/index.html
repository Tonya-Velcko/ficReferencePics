            <p>Here are modified hero costumes for different characters and a somewhat accurate image of Miiko (featuring my mediocre Photoshop skills)! I will be adding a few more altered outfits here because I hate how sexualized some of the characters' costumes are in the show. They are literal children. Dress them accordingly.</p>

                <p>I took out the boob window and made her costume into a two piece. I also modified the bulky belt and clunky bookshelf on her butt. It is now a sleeker model with a book pouch on her hip. I kept her boots the same even though they don't quite match the sporty style because I was tired and wanted to be done, so if you want to imagine sportier boots you can. There is a zipper for the top and a low back in case she has to make larger items. Her winter outfit just adds a cape like in canon.</p>

                <p>You'd think it would be simple to find a good picture of anime hair in a bun, but you'd be wrong. I had to use someone else's drawing (I unfortunately don't remember the artist's name) but I only took the hair and changed the shading and color drastically so really only the original silhouette remains. Everything else is a chimera of different mha characters.</p>

                <p>Here's Miiko's hero costume! I tried to incorporate some nods to Eraserhead's while still making it original. Since her quirk makes her hair float and her eyes glow, I wanted to include things to mask that, because she plans to be an underground hero like her parents. She doesn't want villains to know when she's using her quirk so she wants to hide those tells. This is also why she keeps her hair in a bun.</p>
                <p>The band on her wrist is a digital bank of royalty free songs that connects to the speaker on her belt. With a few buttons, she can have music for her quirk any time, any where.</p>
