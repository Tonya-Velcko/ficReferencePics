        <h3>Characters and Costumes</h3>
        <h4>Featuring my mediocre Photoshop skills!</h4>
            <p>Here are modified hero costumes for Yaoyorozu and Hagakure. I hate their canon costumes so I fixed them. They are literal children. They should be dressed accordingly.</p>
            <image src="images/yaoMomoAlt.jpg"/>
                <p>I took out the boob window and made her costume into a two piece. I also modified the bulky belt and clunky bookshelf on her butt. It is now a sleeker model with a book pouch on her hip. I kept her boots the same even though they don't quite match the sporty style because I was tired and wanted to be done, so if you want to imagine sportier boots you can. There is a zipper for the top and a low back in case she has to make larger items. Her winter outfit just adds a cape like in canon.</p>
            <image src="images/hagakureAlt.jpg"/>
                <p>This is a costume mostly made out of Hagakure's hair (or something of her DNA). Since Mirio's costume is able to permeate with him, it stands to reason that Hagakure's would be invisible, due to her quirk. So, only her gloves are not made from her hair and can be seen. Everything else is invisible, shown in the image as more transluscent (but that's just so you can see it). I never understood why they made Hagakure run around completely naked in canon when there is an established canonic work around. Give this poor girl some clothes! Especially during the winter! (Speaking of, Hagakure has an undershirt and leggings made from her hair that she wears under the costume during the winter)</p>
                <p>And here are somewhat accurate images of Miiko!</p>

                <p>You'd think it would be simple to find a good picture of anime hair in a bun, but you'd be wrong. I had to use someone else's drawing (I unfortunately don't remember the artist's name) but I only took the hair and changed the shading and color drastically so really only the original silhouette remains. Everything else is a chimera of different mha characters.</p>
            <image src="images/MiikoAizawaHero.jpg"/>
                <p>Here's Miiko's hero costume! I tried to incorporate some nods to Eraserhead's while still making it original. Since her quirk makes her hair float and her eyes glow, I wanted to include things to mask that, because she plans to be an underground hero like her parents. She doesn't want villains to know when she's using her quirk so she wants to hide those tells. This is also why she keeps her hair in a bun.</p>
                <p>The band on her wrist is a digital bank of royalty free songs that connects to the speaker on her belt. With a few buttons, she can have music for her quirk any time, any where.</p>
